###### Identify Trends & Draw Trendlines

This folder contains the source code for this [video](https://youtu.be/Cr7nQYl3iH8).

## Description

Some traders consider trends as essential tool for their trading strategies, allowing them to identify longer-term direction of the price of an asset. One reeason why it is important to know whether we're in a trending market is because there are strategies which work much better in trending markets and there are others which work best in non-trending markets. 

There are multiple ways in which traders identify trends, either by computing two or more moving averages and checking whether they're all going in the same direction or by drawing trendlines, which are straight lines connecting the minimas or maximas of an asset over a period of time. 

For a trendline to be valid, generally speaking, the price needs to touch it at least two times (the more the better) and if the line is drawn above the price, then the price shouldn't close above it (otherwise the trend was broken).

In this video we will be writing code to identify and draw trend lines on any asset of your choice.
